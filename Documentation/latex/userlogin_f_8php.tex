This is the front-\/end for the User Login page.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the front-\/end for the User Login page. 

I created this file to provide a user interface for users to log in to the library system. It includes a login form where users can input their credentials, which are sent to the backend for authentication.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I included the {\ttfamily \doxylink{userlogin_8php}{userlogin.\+php}} backend file to handle the login functionality.
\item The page includes a "{}\+BACK"{} button to navigate back to the landing page.
\item The login form collects the following details\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Email
\item Password
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The form uses the {\ttfamily POST} method to securely send the data to the backend file {\ttfamily \doxylink{userlogin_8php}{userlogin.\+php}}.
\item I used external CSS files for styling and a custom font for the design.
\item The page is fully responsive and ensures compatibility across different devices.
\end{DoxyItemize}
