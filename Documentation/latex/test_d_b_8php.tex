This file is used for testing purposes to verify the database connection.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is used for testing purposes to verify the database connection. 

I created this file to test whether the database connection is successfully established using the {\ttfamily \doxylink{connect_d_b_8php}{connect\+DB.\+php}} file. It includes the database connection script and displays a success message if the connection is successful.

\item If the connection is successful, I display a success message.
\item This file is intended for testing purposes only and does not perform any other operations.
