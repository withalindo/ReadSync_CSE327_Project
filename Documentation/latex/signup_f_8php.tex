This is the front-\/end for the Sign-\/\+Up page.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the front-\/end for the Sign-\/\+Up page. 

I created this file to allow new users to register for the application. It provides a form where users can input their details, which are then sent to the backend for processing.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I used external CSS files for styling and a custom font for the design.
\item The page includes a "{}\+BACK"{} button that redirects users to the landing page.
\item The form collects the following user details\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Name
\item Email
\item Date of Birth
\item Phone Number
\item Username
\item Password
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The form uses the {\ttfamily POST} method to securely send the data to the backend file {\ttfamily \doxylink{signup_8php}{signup.\+php}}.
\item The page is fully responsive and ensures compatibility across different devices.
