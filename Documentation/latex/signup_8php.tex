This is the backend file for handling user registration.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the backend file for handling user registration. 

I created this file to process the data submitted from the sign-\/up form. It validates the input, sanitizes the data, and inserts the new user\textquotesingle{}s information into the database.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I included the {\ttfamily \doxylink{connect_d_b_8php}{connect\+DB.\+php}} file to establish a connection to the database.
\item The script retrieves the form data using the {\ttfamily POST} method and sanitizes it to prevent malicious input.
\item I implemented input validation to ensure that all required fields are filled.
\item If the input is valid, the script uses a prepared statement to securely insert the user\textquotesingle{}s data into the database.
\item If the registration is successful, I display a success message and redirect the user to the login page.
\item If there is an error during the process, I display an appropriate error message and redirect the user back to the landing page.
