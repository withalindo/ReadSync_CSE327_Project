Front-\/end for adding new books to the library system.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Front-\/end for adding new books to the library system. 

I created this file to provide a user interface for administrators to add new books. It includes a form for inputting book details and a navigation menu for accessing other administrative features.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The form collects details like Book Name, ISBN, Author Name, Author ID, Category Name, Category ID, Number of Copies, and Book Price.
\item The form uses the {\ttfamily POST} method to send data to the backend file {\ttfamily \doxylink{addbooks_8php}{addbooks.\+php}}.
\item Includes a side navigation menu for accessing other features like updating books, viewing stock, and logging out.
\item Java\+Script functions handle the opening and closing of the side navigation menu.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ensure the backend file {\ttfamily \doxylink{addbooks_8php}{addbooks.\+php}} is configured to handle the form submission.
\item This page is for administrators only.
