This is the front-\/end for updating the number of copies of a specific book.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the front-\/end for updating the number of copies of a specific book. 

I created this file to provide a user interface for updating the number of copies of a book in the library system. It includes a form for inputting book details and a navigation menu for accessing other administrative features.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I used external CSS files for styling and a custom font for the design.
\item The page includes a side navigation menu with links to other update and management features.
\item The form collects the following details\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Book Name
\item ISBN Number
\item New Number of Copies
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The form uses the {\ttfamily POST} method to securely send the data to the backend file {\ttfamily \doxylink{update_book_copy_8php}{update\+Book\+Copy.\+php}}.
\item I added Java\+Script functions to handle the opening and closing of the side navigation menu.
\item The page is fully responsive and ensures compatibility across different devices.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ensure that the backend file {\ttfamily \doxylink{update_book_copy_8php}{update\+Book\+Copy.\+php}} is properly configured to handle the form submission.
\item This page is intended for use by administrators only.
