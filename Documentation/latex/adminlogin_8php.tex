\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the backend file for handling admin login functionality. 

I created this file to process the login requests from the admin login page. It validates the admin\textquotesingle{}s credentials, checks them against the database, and starts a session if the login is successful.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I included the {\ttfamily \doxylink{connect_d_b_8php}{connect\+DB.\+php}} file to establish a connection to the database.
\item The script checks if the login form was submitted and retrieves the admin\textquotesingle{}s credentials.
\item I implemented input validation to ensure that the fields are not empty.
\item The script uses a prepared statement to securely query the database for the admin\textquotesingle{}s information.
\item If the credentials are valid, I start a session and redirect the admin to the dashboard.
\item If the credentials are invalid, I display appropriate error messages using Java\+Script alerts.
