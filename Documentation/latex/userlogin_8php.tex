\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file handles the backend logic for user login functionality. 

I created this file to process login requests from the user login page. It validates the user\textquotesingle{}s credentials, checks them against the database, and starts a session if the login is successful.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I included the {\ttfamily \doxylink{connect_d_b_8php}{connect\+DB.\+php}} file to establish a connection to the database.
\item The script retrieves the user\textquotesingle{}s email and password from the form submission.
\item I implemented input validation to ensure that the fields are not empty and the email is in a valid format.
\item The script uses a prepared statement to securely query the database for the user\textquotesingle{}s information.
\item If the credentials are valid, I start a session and redirect the user to their dashboard.
\item If the credentials are invalid, I display appropriate error messages using Java\+Script alerts.
\item I also close the database connection and prepared statement after processing.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ensure that the {\ttfamily users} table in the database contains the appropriate schema for user authentication.
