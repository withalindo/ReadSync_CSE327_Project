This is the front-\/end for the Admin Dashboard.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the front-\/end for the Admin Dashboard. 

I created this file to provide the HTML structure and functionality for the admin dashboard. It includes a side navigation menu, buttons for navigating to different sections, and Java\+Script functions to handle the menu\textquotesingle{}s open and close actions.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I used external CSS files for styling and a custom font for the design.
\item The side navigation menu allows admins to access the dashboard, requested books, book stock, and an update panel. There\textquotesingle{}s also a logout option.
\item The page is responsive and includes a background overlay that appears when the side menu is open.
\item I added Java\+Script functions to handle the menu\textquotesingle{}s behavior dynamically.
