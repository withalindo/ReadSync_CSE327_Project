This is the landing page for the application.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is the landing page for the application. 

I created this file to serve as the entry point for users and administrators. It provides options for logging in as a user or an admin and includes a link for new users to sign up.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I used external CSS files for styling and a custom font for the design.
\item The background features a looping video to enhance the visual appeal of the page.
\item The page includes three main options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Log in as a user.
\item Log in as an admin.
\item Sign up for new users.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The page is fully responsive and ensures compatibility across different devices.
